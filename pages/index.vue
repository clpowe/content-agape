		TESTIMONIALS
	</h2>
	<p class="editable">
		I was devastated after failing the Bar on my first attempt. I was referred
		to Agape Bar Prep and committed to passing this test the second time around.
		Tishia and the staff at Agape fully prepared me for my second round, and I
		passed! The instructors are personally invested in each student passing.
