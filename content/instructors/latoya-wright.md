# Latoya Wright

Ms. Wright is the Chief Writing Strategist for Agape Christian Bar Prep. She has coined the phrase “excellence should be a lifestyle, not a standard.” Armed with that mindset, Ms. Wright is very passionate about helping students maximize the potential housed within them.

Prior to joining Agape Christian Bar Prep, Ms. Wright worked as a substitute teacher in the Hartford, East Hartford and New Britain school districts while deciding what to do with her law degree. She also interned under the tutelage of a solo practitioner whose work is primarily focused on Immigration Law. During this time, Ms. Wright drafted legal briefs for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review. In addition, Ms. Wright had the privilege of working with persons filing petitions under the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA"), persons seeking Adjustment of Status and Citizenship, persons filing petitions on behalf of spouses and children, and persons in Removal Proceedings.

Ms. Wright is a graduate of Boston University School of Law. During her tenure in law school, Ms. Wright participated in the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic where she and her partner successfully helped a Ghanaian native acquire a grant of Asylum in the United States. In addition, Ms. Wright received a certificate for her dedication to pro bono work. Lastly, Ms. Wright was a Student Attorney and then Volunteer Attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project (“IRAP").

Ms. Wright presently works full-time as an attorney at Medtronic, a global healthcare solutions company.

Though a native of Jamaica, Ms. Wright has been living in the United States for more than a decade. Nonetheless, Ms. Wright has founded an organization called Raising the Bar Foundation (“RTBF") which helps students and schools in underserved communities in Jamaica combat financial hardship.

In her past-time, Ms. Wright enjoys reading, binge watching television, doing pro bono work and researching and drafting briefs for fellow attorneys. Ms. Wright also devotes time to being the chief legal officer of Source Development Hub, a New Haven-based social enterprise that focuses on providing software-based solutions to housing for low-resource communities.
