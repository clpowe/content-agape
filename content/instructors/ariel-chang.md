title: 'Ariel Chang'

description: 'Ms. Chang is deeply committed and passionate about helping students pass the bar exam. Her tutoring is based on her own first failed attempt to pass the bar exam, and subsequently needing to work full time while studying for her second attempt. She empathizes with the different anxieties that first time and repeat takers experience, and the difficulty of balancing a full time job with bar studying. As such, Ms. Chang focuses on meeting students where they are and is invested in providing whatever personalized, efficient, and effective learning strategies students need to pass. She seeks to put her subjects in a real-world context to not only help students understand the material, but also to help students realize that the bar exam can be conquered. Ms. Chang works as a federal property attorney in Boston. She is a graduate of Northeastern University School of Law, where she was an editor for the Northeastern University Law Review and a Research and Writing Teaching Assistant. During her free time, she enjoys spending time with her husband and two cats, knitting, and listening to audiobooks.'
