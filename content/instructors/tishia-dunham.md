## Teacher [Biography]{.text-red}

Ms. Dunham is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Agape Christian Bar Prep. She is a former bar exam grader who is passionate about helping law students excel while in law school and prepare to pass the bar exam after graduation. She has been helping first-time and repeat takers prepare to pass the bar exam in jurisdictions across the United States for almost 20 years.
During Ms. Dunham’s three-year tenure as a faculty member and director of Bar Preparation Services at Stetson University College of Law, Ms. Dunham used her God-given wisdom and insight to develop curricula and programming that helped increase Stetson’s bar passage rates for first-time bar exam takers to number one in the state of Florida. Under Ms. Dunham's direction, the bar passage rates for first-time bar exam takers at Stetson peaked at 93%. While at Stetson, Ms. Dunham also helped increase the bar passage rates for repeat bar exam takers.

Ms. Dunham has always been passionate about helping students maximize their potential and defeat the odds. Upon obtaining her bachelor’s degree in Communications and English from Florida State University, Ms. Dunham taught high school English to tenth graders who read on a fourth-grade reading level. Ms. Dunham helped these students develop the skills needed to pass the Florida Writing Exam, a then-statewide exam administered to all tenth graders.

Before starting Agape Christian Bar Prep, in addition to having been a faculty member at Stetson, Ms. Dunham was a litigator in Tampa, Florida where she specialized in employment, commercial and real property litigation.

Ms. Dunham is a graduate of Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. She enjoys serving her community through her church, spending time with her family, traveling, reading and writing. She is the co-author of Florida Constitutional Law: Cases and Materials (Carolina Academic Press, 2022).
