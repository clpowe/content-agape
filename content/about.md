## The [history]{.text-red} of Agape Christian Bar prep

Agape Christian Bar Prep was started in 2015 after our founder received instructions from God to “help His people”. Since that time, God has used Agape Christian Bar Prep to help students prepare for law school exams and pass the bar exam in jurisdictions across the United States. With God’s help, Agape Christian Bar Prep builds and restores the confidence, hope and vision of students whose dreams of becoming attorneys have been shattered by their law school experience or multiple failed attempts at passing the bar exam. God uses Agape Christian Bar Prep to remind these students of the thoughts and plans He has for them – thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give them an expected end.
