Agape is the reason I passed the bar exam. Not only did the Agape family provide amazing resources and strategies that equipped me with the knowledge to conquer the bar exam, but Agape also provided me with the confidence by incorporating additional exercises and sessions that prepared mentally, spiritually and physically. The Agape family not only made me a better bar taker- they made me a better Attorney.
