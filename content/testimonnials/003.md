Agape has truly been a blessing to me! I learned so much from my tutors. The one-on-one sessions that I had with my tutor not only helped me with the bar exam but with my spiritual growth as well. I am so happy that I was a part of the group for the February 2022 bar exam. Now I can say that I am one and done!
