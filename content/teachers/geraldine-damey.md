## Teacher [Biography]{.text-red}

Ms. Damey is dedicated and passionate about helping others, particularly, individuals with diverse educational, socio-economic, and cultural backgrounds. As a child of immigrant parents, Ms. Damey understands the educational challenges and unique opportunities that some individuals face as students. Accordingly, she appreciates the value this diversity brings to the legal field and is genuinely committed to helping each Agape Christian Bar Prep student enter the legal profession. In addition to working with Agape Christian Bar Prep students, Ms. Damey practices real property and real estate law as a full-time attorney.

Ms. Damey’s passion for teaching ignited during her tenure as a Teach for America (“TFA”) corps member in Atlanta, Georgia. As a TFA corps member, Ms. Damey taught second-grade students in an under-resourced public school in a low-income community while obtaining her Masters of Arts in Teaching. She utilized various teaching and learning techniques that were tailored to her students’ varying needs, which led her students to achieve significant academic gains. Ironically, Ms. Damey was placed to teach in the same school system where she attended school; this eye-opening experience allowed Ms. Damey to relate to her students as a “product” of the community, which was well-received by her students and their families. Ms. Damey’s teaching experience coupled with her personal experience as a student allowed her to witness the educational disparities that lie within her own community, which cultivated her interest in pursuing a legal career that would allow her to advocate and help others with unique and challenging needs.

Ms. Damey is a graduate of Howard University School of Law (“Howard”). During her time at Howard, she served as the captain of the International Moot Court Team and worked as a student attorney in the Civil Rights Clinic where her and her colleagues drafted amicus curiae briefs for the Supreme Court. Ms. Damey believes her time as a second-grade teacher strengthened and developed her leadership and problem-solving skills inside and outside of the classroom and has contributed to her strides as a licensed attorney. During Ms. Damey’s free time, she enjoys spending time with family and friends, binge-watching crime drama TV-shows, and traveling.
